This project transcends basic reporting; it’s an immersive visual autopsy of supermarket sales dynamics across three distinct city branches. By leveraging the Power BI engine, we transmuted raw transactional logs into high-fidelity strategic insights.

## The Analytical Pipeline

The transformation journey within the **Power Query Editor** was rigorous:
* **Data Sanitization:** Rectified inconsistent branch naming (e.g., standardizing "C" branch labels) and handled null value propagation 
* **Temporal Alignment:** Converting chaotic strings into structured time-series data to facilitate monthly comparative audits 
* **Integrity Validation:** Deploying Column Quality and Distribution profiles to ensure 100% data fidelity before visualization

## Interactive Dashboard Features

The final deliverable is a dynamic command center featuring:
- **Revenue vs. Manufacturing Cost (COGS):** A dual-axis audit revealing the thinning margins during February's sales slump 
- **Pareto-Driven Product Insights:** Identifying the "informational gold" within high-velocity product lines like Food and Beverages 
- **Customer Behavioral Segmentation:** Visualizing the gender-based spending pulse through cross-filtered Bar and Donut charts

## Strategic Takeaways

* **February Anomaly:** The data unmasked a significant revenue dip in February, triggering a need for seasonal promotional intervention 
* **Branch Synergy:** Identified Branch 'C' as a leading revenue hub, despite having similar inventory volume to other branches
